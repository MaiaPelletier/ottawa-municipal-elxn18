# Assignment 5

The recent federal election had a 64 % turnout (fraction of people who were eligible to vote who actually did). I would have expected more people to vote, because this was expected to be, and indeed turned out to be a close race.

Using the 2018 municipal election data investigate the claim that closer races lead to higher turnouts.

Use whatever tools/plots/stats/explanations you need, but as always
- it must be reproducible and written as a report to your boss.
